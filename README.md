# Automatic.ai component-based machine learning framework core components ("ATM.ai")

## The Repository

This repository is where we (Automatic.ai) develop the core components (ATM), help documentation (WTF), emotional support (Freakout) and guidance (helpmechoose) used by the [Automatic.ai](https://automatic.ai) machine-learning IDE (Rockstar).

It is expected that most uses of these components by the average developer will be within the IDE itself, by cloning the components then modifying them to taste as one builds a project.

[Automatic.ai](https://automatic.ai) is a distribution of `ATM` repository with Automatic.ai specific customizations released under a traditional [License](https://automatic.ai/-/terms).

[Automatic.ai](https://automatic.ai) combines the simplicity of a drag-and-drop block-snapping editor with what developers need for their core intelligent-service-building projects. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along a rich extensibility model and integrated social network and marketplace.

Automatic.ai is cloud-native and is updated continously.
