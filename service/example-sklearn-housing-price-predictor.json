	"description": "This service predicts the value of houses in the Boston area. It uses the UC Irvine dataset from 1978 containing Boston housing data. There are about 500 items in the dataset and each item lists features of a house. The CSV dataset was split into training data and testing data, and used to train and test a model using Linear Regression. This service can be cloned and trained with any CSV dataset, supervised or not, and then used, similarly to this sevice, to predict some value of new, unseen data with respect to that dataset",
